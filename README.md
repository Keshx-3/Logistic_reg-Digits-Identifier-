# **Digits Identifier using Scikit-Learn**

This repository contains a project that uses the Scikit-Learn `load_digits` dataset to predict handwritten digits (0-9) using various machine learning algorithms.

## **Project Overview**

The project demonstrates the application of machine learning algorithms to classify handwritten digits. The dataset used is the `digits` dataset, which is a part of the Scikit-Learn library. This dataset includes 8x8 pixel images of digits, and the goal is to correctly predict the digit represented by each image.

## **Dataset**

The `load_digits` dataset from Scikit-Learn is used in this project. It consists of 1,797 grayscale images of size 8x8 pixels, with each image representing a digit from 0 to 9.

- **Number of Instances:** 1,797
- **Number of Attributes:** 64 (each attribute represents a pixel in an 8x8 image)
- **Classes:** 10 (digits 0-9)
